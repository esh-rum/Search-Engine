Architecture

Architecture is the art and science of designing and constructing buildings and structures. It combines functionality and aesthetics to create spaces that meet human needs while enhancing the environment. Architectural styles vary widely, influenced by cultural, historical, and technological factors, from classical and Gothic to modern and sustainable designs.

Sustainable architecture has gained prominence as the construction industry seeks to reduce its environmental impact. Innovations in materials, energy efficiency, and design practices are shaping the future of architecture, emphasizing resilience and eco-friendliness. Architects are increasingly incorporating green spaces, renewable energy sources, and sustainable materials into their designs.
