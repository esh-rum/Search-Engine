Healthcare

Healthcare is the provision of medical services, prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of illness and disease to individuals and communities. It encompasses a broad range of services, including primary care, specialty care, emergency care, and public health initiatives aimed at promoting health and preventing illness. Access to quality healthcare is a fundamental human right and a key determinant of individual and societal well-being. However, disparities in access to healthcare persist, particularly in low-income and marginalized communities, where barriers such as poverty, geographic isolation, and discrimination limit access to essential services. 
Universal health coverage, which ensures that all individuals have access to needed healthcare services without suffering financial hardship, is essential for achieving health equity and social justice. Investing in healthcare systems, strengthening primary care, and addressing social determinants of health are critical for building resilient and equitable healthcare systems that meet the needs of all people, regardless of their background or circumstances.
