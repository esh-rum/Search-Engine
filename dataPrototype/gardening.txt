Gardening

Gardening is the practice of cultivating plants and managing gardens for aesthetic, recreational, or food production purposes. It ranges from small backyard plots to large botanical gardens, providing a way to connect with nature, relax, and produce fresh, homegrown food. Gardening can also support biodiversity by creating habitats for various species of plants, insects, and birds.

The benefits of gardening extend beyond the physical activity; it can improve mental health by reducing stress and fostering a sense of accomplishment. Urban gardening initiatives, such as community gardens and rooftop farms, promote sustainable living and provide green spaces in cities. These efforts contribute to environmental conservation and food security in urban areas.
