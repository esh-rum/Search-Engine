Global

Global health is the study and practice of improving health and achieving equity in health outcomes for all people worldwide. It addresses a broad range of issues, including infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases, maternal and child health, nutrition, mental health, and access to healthcare services. Global health initiatives focus on preventing disease, promoting healthy behaviors, and strengthening healthcare systems, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where health disparities are most pronounced. 

Efforts to combat infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis have made significant strides in reducing morbidity and mortality, while initiatives to address non-communicable diseases like diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease are gaining momentum. Global health is inherently interconnected, requiring collaboration and cooperation among governments, organizations, and communities to address health challenges and achieve health equity for all people, regardless of geography or socioeconomic status.
