Sociology

Sociology is the study of society, social relationships, and social institutions. It examines how individuals and groups interact, the structures of societies, and the processes that maintain or change these structures. Sociologists explore a wide range of topics, including family dynamics, education, religion, crime, and social inequality. By analyzing patterns of social behavior and the effects of social institutions, sociology seeks to understand the complexities of social life and the factors that influence human behavior. Sociological research can inform policies and practices that address social issues and improve the quality of life for individuals and communities.
