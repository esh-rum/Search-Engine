Poetry

Poetry is a literary form that uses rhythm, meter, and expressive language to evoke emotions and convey ideas. It encompasses a wide range of styles and traditions, from classical sonnets and haikus to free verse and spoken word. Poets use imagery, metaphor, and symbolism to create vivid, thought-provoking works that resonate with readers.

Poetry has the power to capture the human experience in a concise and impactful way. It can be personal, political, or philosophical, reflecting the poet's inner world and the external society. Contemporary poetry continues to evolve, embracing diverse voices and experimental forms, while digital platforms have made it more accessible to a global audience.
