Comedy

Comedy is a genre of entertainment that aims to amuse and entertain audiences through humor. It encompasses various forms, including stand-up, sitcoms, films, and improv theater. Comedy often reflects societal norms and challenges, using satire, parody, and slapstick to address and critique contemporary issues while making people laugh.

The role of comedy extends beyond entertainment; it can be a powerful tool for social commentary and bringing people together. Comedians and writers use humor to highlight injustices, question authority, and offer new perspectives on everyday life. The digital age has expanded the reach of comedy, with online platforms providing new avenues for comedic expression and engagement.
