Global Warming

Global warming refers to the long-term rise in Earth's average surface temperature due to human activities, primarily the emission of greenhouse gases. This phenomenon has led to significant changes in weather patterns, increased frequency of extreme weather events, and the melting of polar ice caps. The consequences of global warming are far-reaching, affecting ecosystems, biodiversity, and human societies.

Mitigating global warming requires a concerted effort from all sectors of society, including governments, businesses, and individuals. Transitioning to renewable energy sources, enhancing energy efficiency, and adopting sustainable practices are critical steps. International agreements like the Paris Agreement aim to unite countries in reducing carbon emissions and limiting global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
