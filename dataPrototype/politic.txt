Political Science

Political science is the study of government systems, political activities, political thoughts, and political behavior. It encompasses various subfields, including comparative politics, international relations, political theory, and public administration. Political scientists analyze the structure and function of governments, the impact of policies, the behavior of voters, and the dynamics of power and governance. They also study the relationships between different countries and the factors that influence international conflict and cooperation. Through research and analysis, political science seeks to understand the complexities of political systems and contribute to the development of effective and just governance practices.
