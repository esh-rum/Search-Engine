Astronomy

Astronomy is the scientific study of celestial objects, space, and the universe as a whole. It involves observing and analyzing stars, planets, galaxies, and other astronomical phenomena. Astronomers use telescopes and other instruments to collect data on light, radiation, and other signals from space. This information helps us understand the origins, evolution, and physical properties of celestial bodies. Astronomy also explores fundamental questions about the nature of the universe, such as the existence of dark matter and dark energy, and the potential for extraterrestrial life. Advances in astronomy have led to significant discoveries, such as the identification of exoplanets and the observation of gravitational waves, expanding our knowledge of the cosmos.
