Marine Biology

Marine biology is the scientific study of organisms in the ocean or other marine bodies of water. This field encompasses a vast range of topics, from the smallest plankton to the largest whales. Marine biologists investigate the behaviors, interactions, and adaptations of marine life in diverse environments, including coral reefs, deep-sea trenches, and coastal ecosystems. Research in marine biology helps us understand the critical role oceans play in global processes, such as climate regulation and the carbon cycle. Marine biologists also study the impacts of human activities, such as pollution, overfishing, and climate change, on marine ecosystems. Through conservation efforts, marine biology aims to protect marine biodiversity and ensure sustainable use of ocean resources.
