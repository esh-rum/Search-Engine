Justice

Social justice is the principle of fair and equitable distribution of resources, rights, and opportunities in society, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, or other characteristics. It encompasses the pursuit of equality, human rights, and dignity for all individuals and communities. Social justice aims to address systemic inequalities, discrimination, and injustices that perpetuate poverty, marginalization, and exclusion. It involves promoting access to education, healthcare, housing, employment, and justice for marginalized groups and advocating for policies and practices that uphold human rights and promote social inclusion. 

Social justice movements advocate for change through activism, advocacy, and policy reform, challenging power structures and promoting solidarity and collective action. Achieving social justice requires ongoing commitment, collaboration, and solidarity among individuals, organizations, and governments to create a more just and equitable world for all people.
