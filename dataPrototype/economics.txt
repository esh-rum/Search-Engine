Economics

Economics is the social science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. It explores how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices about allocating resources to satisfy their needs and wants. Economics is divided into two main branches: microeconomics, which focuses on individual and business decision-making, and macroeconomics, which examines the economy as a whole, including inflation, unemployment, and economic growth. Economists use theories and models to analyze economic behavior, develop policies, and predict future trends. Economic principles are applied in various fields, including finance, healthcare, education, and environmental policy, influencing decisions that affect everyday life and global markets.
