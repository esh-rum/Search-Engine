Geology

Geology is the scientific study of the Earth, its structure, materials, processes, and history. It encompasses the examination of rocks, minerals, and fossils to understand the planet's composition and the dynamic processes that have shaped its surface over billions of years. Geologists study phenomena such as plate tectonics, volcanic activity, and erosion to unravel the Earth's complex history and predict future geological events.

Geology has practical applications in various fields, including natural resource management, environmental protection, and hazard mitigation. By understanding geological processes, scientists can locate and extract valuable resources like minerals and fossil fuels, assess and manage natural hazards such as earthquakes and landslides, and contribute to environmental conservation efforts. The insights gained from geology are crucial for informed decision-making and sustainable development.
