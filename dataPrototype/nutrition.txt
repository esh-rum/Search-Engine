Nutrition

Nutrition is the science of how food and drink affect human health. It involves studying the nutrients in food, how the body uses them, and the relationship between diet, health, and disease. Proper nutrition is essential for growth, development, and maintaining good health throughout life. It helps prevent malnutrition, obesity, and chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Nutritional science also examines how dietary choices can impact mental health and cognitive function. By promoting balanced diets rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins, nutrition science aims to enhance overall well-being and quality of life.
