Mythology

Mythology refers to the collection of myths, or traditional stories, that belong to a particular culture or religion. These myths often explain natural phenomena, human behavior, and the origins of the world, featuring gods, heroes, and supernatural beings. Greek, Norse, and Egyptian mythologies are among the most well-known, each with its pantheon of deities and epic tales.

Mythology continues to influence contemporary culture, inspiring literature, art, and popular media. Themes from ancient myths are frequently reinterpreted and retold, reflecting modern values and concerns. Studying mythology provides insights into the beliefs and values of past societies and helps us understand the cultural foundations of the present.
